    <h2>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.</h2>
    <p>This lasagne verde made with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself.</p> 
    <p>It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces lean ground pork</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.
